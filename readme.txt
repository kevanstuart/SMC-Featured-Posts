SMC Featured Posts allows you to select posts to be featured in a list or widget

== Description ==

SMC Featured Posts allows you to manage a list of posts to be displayed either in a list
accessible by the shortcode [smc_featured_posts] or a widget.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `smc-featured-posts` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

You will find a new column in the posts list called "Is Featured" - the contents of which
will enable to set whether a post is featured or not.

When editing a post, there is a meta box on the right that enables you to check whether
a post should be featured or not.

There is a options page (Settings -> Featured Posts) that allows you to set a title to
display and a display count when using the shortcode - the widget is the standard interface
under Appearance -> Widgets
